        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>Lacking any sense of purpose after taking revenge on Justice, the Number 1 headband bearer, Afro Samurai, spends his days making wooden sculptures of historical figures and has not fought a duel in years. Jinno, his adoptive brother who is now an emotionless cyborg, and his sister, Lady Sio, ambush and beat him severely, while stealing the headband and his deceased father Rokutaro's mandible. Sio tells Afro that they will resurrect Rokutaro and use him for vengeance, challenging Afro to find the Number 2 headband if he has the will to fight.</p>
		  <p>After getting his sword reforged, Afro goes to a gambling house, where the last surviving member of the Empty Seven Clan, Brother 3, challenges him to a dice game for the identity of the Number 2. Afro discovers Brother 3 cheating and forces him to reveal that the Number 2 belonged to the ronin Shichigoro. Afro unknowingly saves Shichigoro's adopted son Kotaro and later kills the latter, leaving Kotaro to swear revenge. Afro claims the Number 2 headband and goes on to destroy three cyborg warriors, who turn out to be Sio's foster brothers and sister. Sio uses forbidden science to resurrect Rokutaro, turning him into a soulless warrior.<p/>
		<p>With Afro injured by his previous fight, Rokutaro mortally wounds his son, choking him until he falls unconscious. The sight of Afro dying causes Jinno to remember the bond they once shared as brothers, and he attacks Rokutaro, who mutilates his body. Sio tries to save her brother, but Rokutaro impales her through Jinno's body. After they die, a spark from Jinno's body travels through Sio's spilled blood and revives Afro. He accepts that Rokutaro is not his real father and kills him. Afro retrieves the Number 1 headband and gives the Number 2 to Kotaro, telling him that he will be ready for when he wants to avenge Shichigoro. While Afro travels to Mount Shumi and searches for a challenger as the Number 1, his imaginary companion Ninja Ninja reappears before him, stating about the endless cycle of revenge and bloodshed.</p>
